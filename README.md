I'm benn! I'm currently a 3Y BS Computer Science student studying at Ateneo de Naga University. Admittedly, I have very little experience with making coding projects of any kind. The extent of my programming experience are the exercises they give out at school that's more akin to problems you'd see in programming competitions. *And even then* I'm not very good. I've basically forgotten a lot of what I learned after going through a depressive slump during the pandemic. 

I'm looking to change that though! I think it's finally time that I get myself together, do more, and take on projects that I wouldn't normally do. I hope y'all will help out a lost programmer here! And I look forward to collaborating with y'all (even though I'm not sure what that entails yet)!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning - Web Development (through The Odin Project)!; relearning C++
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
